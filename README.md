Introduction
The aim of this project is to identify super spreaders on social media platforms. Super spreaders are defined as accounts or individuals that exert a disproportionate influence on the spread of information or misinformation online. The ability to detect such entities is vital for understanding the dynamics of information dissemination and for taking steps to curb the spread of false information.

Repository Structure
The repository is structured into various directories, each with a specific role in the project:

Classification/
This directory contains the code for the classification models that are at the core of the project. These models are trained to identify potential super spreaders based on various metrics and patterns observed in social media data.

Data collection and cleaning/
Here you'll find scripts responsible for gathering and preprocessing the data. These scripts are designed to automate the collection of social media posts and profiles and to clean the data in preparation for analysis.

Datasets for classification/
This directory is where the datasets used to train the classification models are stored. It includes preprocessed data that is ready to be fed into machine learning algorithms for model training.

Web development/
This directory holds the web application code that provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the classification models. The web application allows users to input data and receive predictions on potential super spreaders on social media.
